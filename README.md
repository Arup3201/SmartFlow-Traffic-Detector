# SmartFlow Traffic Detector

Traffic Detector is a feature of the original software SmartFlow Traffic Manager to fetch the traffic flow data and use for further analysis.

## Project Goals

1. Object Detection of vehicles and pedestrians on the road present in the image in the road junction.

2. Monitoring the objects in the video feed.

3. Mapping the objects to the map and showing the movements of the respective objects in the map.

4. Finding traffic flow data like traffic volume, count of each vehicles and pedestrians along with their respective direction.

**Object Detection Process:**

1. **Feature Extraction:**
   
   - Use traditional computer vision techniques to extract relevant features from the input image. These features might include color histograms, texture information, edge information, or any other characteristics that are relevant to your object detection task.

2. **Region Proposal:**
   
   - Implement a region proposal mechanism to identify potential regions of interest in the image. This could be achieved using methods like selective search or simple heuristics based on color or texture.

3. **Machine Learning Classification:**
   
   - Train a machine learning classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests) on the extracted features. Each region of interest is classified as containing the object of interest or not.

4. **Post-Processing:**
   
   - Apply post-processing techniques to refine the results, such as non-maximum suppression to eliminate duplicate detections and filtering based on confidence scores.

**Step-by-Step Strategy for Feature Extraction:**

1. **Image Preprocessing:**
   
   - Preprocess the input images to enhance their quality and make subsequent processing more effective. Common preprocessing steps include resizing, normalization, and noise reduction.

2. **Color Space Conversion:**
   
   - Convert the image to a suitable color space based on the characteristics of the task. For example, you might convert the image to grayscale or use color spaces such as HSV or LAB if color information is essential.

3. **Filtering and Edge Detection:**
   
   - Apply filters or edge detection techniques to capture information about the structure of the image. Common filters include Gaussian filters, Sobel filters, or Canny edge detectors. These steps can help identify important edges and textures.

4. **Histograms and Statistical Features:**
   
   - Compute histograms of pixel intensities or color values to capture global statistical information about the image. Histograms can represent the distribution of intensity values across different regions of the image.

5. **Texture Analysis:**
   
   - Apply texture analysis techniques to capture information about patterns and textures in the image. This could involve methods like Gabor filters or local binary patterns (LBP).

6. **Interest Points and Descriptors:**
   
   - Detect interest points in the image, and compute descriptors that describe the local structure around these points. Common methods include the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) or Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF).

7. **Shape Descriptors:**
   
   - Extract information about the shapes present in the image. This could involve techniques like contour analysis or the extraction of moments to describe the shape of objects.

8. **Spatial Pyramids:**
   
   - Divide the image into different spatial regions and compute features within each region. This helps capture information at multiple scales and spatial resolutions.

9. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   
   - Use PCA or other dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining important information.

10. **Normalization and Scaling:**
    
    - Normalize or scale the extracted features to ensure consistency and comparability across different images.

11. **Feature Vector Formation:**
    
    - Combine the extracted features into a feature vector. This vector represents the image in a high-dimensional feature space.

12. **Machine Learning or Clustering:**
    
    - If using a traditional machine learning approach, feed the feature vectors into a machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees) for classification or regression tasks. If clustering, apply clustering algorithms based on the feature vectors.

13. **Evaluation and Iteration:**
    
    - Evaluate the performance of the feature extraction process and, if necessary, iterate on the steps to improve the representation of important image characteristics.
