# SmartFlow Traffic Detector

Traffic Detector is a feature of the original software SmartFlow Traffic Manager to fetch the traffic flow data and use for further analysis.

## Project Goals

1. Object Detection of vehicles and pedestrians on the road present in the image in the road junction.

2. Monitoring the objects in the video feed.

3. Mapping the objects to the map and showing the movements of the respective objects in the map.

4. Finding traffic flow data like traffic volume, count of each vehicles and pedestrians along with their respective direction.

**Object Detection Model Development Process:**

1. **Feature Extraction:**
   
   - Use traditional computer vision techniques to extract relevant features from the input image. These features might include color histograms, texture information, edge information, or any other characteristics that are relevant to your object detection task.

2. **Region Proposal:**
   
   - Implement a region proposal mechanism to identify potential regions of interest in the image. This could be achieved using methods like selective search or simple heuristics based on color or texture.

3. **Machine Learning Classification:**
   
   - Train a machine learning classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests) on the extracted features. Each region of interest is classified as containing the object of interest or not.

4. **Post-Processing:**
   
   - Apply post-processing techniques to refine the results, such as non-maximum suppression to eliminate duplicate detections and filtering based on confidence scores.
